**Standard Workflow**

1. First, think about the problem, read the codebase to find relevant files and write a plan to todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of tasks that you can mark as completed.
3. Before starting to work, contact me and I will check the plan.
4. Then, start working on the tasks, marking them as completed as you progress.
5. Please, at each step of the way, just give me a detailed explanation of the changes you made.
6. Make each task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid large or complex changes. Each change should impact the code as minimally as possible. It all comes down to simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
8. All terminal commands that Claude Code executes must create an .ps1 files and run it with PowerShell commands, as the operating system is Windows, not Bash.
9. If you need to activate the virtual environment, use the ".venv/Scripts/activate"
10. IMPORTANT: you are in a "uv" system, uv is a python package manager, if you need to add packeges, libraries or frameworks, use the "uv add" command, do not use "pip install" or "uv pip install".
11. after every todo.md that you complete, do a markdown file explaning everything that you change
